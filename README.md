<h1> üëã Creative Coding for Urban Problems </h1>

This repository contains a series of projects completed by me and my teammates during my master‚Äôs degree - Urban Data Science and Analytics at the University of Leeds. Each project addressed a unique urban challenge using data-driven approaches. The included PDF files contain coding outputs (Python and QGIS), presentation slides, and comprehensive analysis results. I welcome any discussions on these topics.

### üçú Topic 1 - Understanding our food environments
* We explored the food environments in Leeds, focusing on the distribution of healthy and unhealthy food options, advertisement assets, and socioeconomic factors.
* Using various datasets like IMD scores, obesity rates, and OpenStreetMap data, the project analysed the correlation between food accessibility and public health outcomes.
* Techniques include <em>**geospatial mapping, data visualisation, and statistical analysis**</em>.

### üßó Topic 2 - Priority places for physical activity 
* This project analysed the proximity, accessibility, and transport options of physical activity facilities in Leeds to assess their impact on residents‚Äò exercise habits and public health.
* Data included the density and proximity of parks, sports centres, and fitness facilities and transportation options. Accessibility and relevant scores/indexes were calculated based on custom metrics.
* Geospatial analysis using Python, <em>**interactive visualisation, and statistical interpretation of accessibility metric**</em>.

### üìñ Topic 3 - Generate planning application reports using generative AI 
* This urban planning project proposed a mixed-use development in Leeds, integrating residential and commercial spaces while addressing environmental and infrastructure challenges. It explored the strengths and weaknesses of existing facilities and planned projects within a 250m radius of a specific development site.
* Factors such as shopping convenience, transportation, recreational facilities, and public services were evaluated. <em>**The large language model is utilised to automate the generation of detailed reports**</em> targeted to different audiences, highlighting project benefits, potential risks, and strategic recommendations for stakeholders.
* <em>**Geospatial Mapping with OpenStreetMap, data analysis and visualisation, and report generation via ChatGPT**</em> to provide insights for residential buyers, renters, and developers.

### üßí Topic 4 - Child Labour in Global Supply Chains
* This project investigated the prevalence of child labour across countries, companies, and commodities using news articles and text analysis.
* News articles were filtered for child labour-related keywords, key information was extracted <em>**using the ChatGPT API**</em>, and visualised to highlight hotspots of exploitation.
* Techniques: <em>**Text mining, data cleaning, and interactive mapping**</em>.

### üåÜ Topic 5 - Twenty Minute Neighbourhoods
* This project explored the spatial distribution of amenities in Bradford to identify and evaluate potential 20-minute neighbourhoods, aiming to prmote accessibility, foster community connectivity, and promote sustainable urban development.
* An 800-meter buffer analysis (as suggested) was applied to calculate proximity and accessibility to essential services like schools, parks, and hospitals. <em>**Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to assign weights**</em> to variables and compute a composite index, while  <em>**K-means clustering classified neighbourhoods**</em> based on amenity density and accessibility. The results were visualised through  <em>**interactive maps**</em>, with strategic recommendations provided for urban planning.
